- have properties of mesh (eg. oc_pos, oc_norm, uv) given to shaders automatically by library
- normal map functionality built-in
- Change to loading images with 4 components instead of 3 (for more flexibility) then change code to expect 4, not 3, components
- Improve model reader or (probably better) find a library to do it instead
